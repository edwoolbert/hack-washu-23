/* Global styles, common utility classes, layout and reset, etc., would go here. */

/* For now, it's empty since we've moved component-specific styles to their respective CSS files. 
   In a real-world scenario, you'd have some base styles or utility classes here. */

/* Example of potential global styles: */

body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

.container {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0 20px;
}

/* ... any other global or utility styles */
